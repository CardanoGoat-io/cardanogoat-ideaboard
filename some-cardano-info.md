## Why Cardano

Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform: the first to be founded on peer-reviewed research and developed through evidence-based methods. It combines pioneering technologies to provide unparalleled security and sustainability to decentralized applications, systems, and societies.

With a leading team of engineers, Cardano exists to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins – to individuals – and be an enabling force for positive change and progress.


Cardano restores trust to global systems – creating, through science, a more secure, transparent, and sustainable foundation for individuals to transact and exchange, systems to govern, and enterprises to grow.

Finance
Identity verification is a key step before accepting new clients into financial institutions or other agencies. Simply opening a new bank account in certain countries takes weeks, for example. Other administrative processes -passport applications, for instance-, even longer. The onboarding process is slow and resource-heavy, often involving multiple third-parties with their own fees, etc.

Atala PRISM can streamline and accelerate onboarding through the utilization of reusable verified credentials. Atala PRISM leverages blockchain technology to deliver a one-click user experience.
